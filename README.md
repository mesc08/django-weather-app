``` Aim of the repository is to build a django-web app and use rest api to track weather of the desired city ```

# Description

This is a web app which opens with a main window where a user has option of both login and signin
If user is already registered will be able to login but if the user is not registered then he has to
register through the register page. After user is successfully logged in the user will enter into
home page where on adding a city on search bar user will be able to check the weather of that particular
region. My aim will be to show the maximum details of the city.
